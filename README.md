===========================

These solutions are to help people who are learning node.js by following the tutorials at http://nodeschool.io/#learn-you-node

Some of my answers are different from the official answers.
I personally preffer to have callback functions separately and do minimal work inside a method and define variables clearly by name.

Hope this will help.

Enjoy your journey with node.js
